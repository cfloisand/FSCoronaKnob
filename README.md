## Corona Knob Control for iOS ##

This knob is a circular control with a colored corona that represents its value. It supports 
both tap and drag gestures to change its value. An optional delegate object allows for 
customized labels to display the value in the middle of the knob as well as setting the 
corona's color dynamically.
